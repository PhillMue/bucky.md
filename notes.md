 ##VIDEO 15: USING METHODS WITH PARAMETERS
    Create a method containing the parameter, for example String name, in the other class. In the main class import the scanner utility so that the user can define the value of 'name'. Afterwards, to use the method call it in the main class.

   To input Strings use input.nextLine();. For example: String put = input.nextLine();
   
   Argument - any extra formation that a program needs to run. e,g (String name) in this case, 'name' is the argument.
   
##VIDEO 16: MANY METHODS AND INSTANCES
Public variables are able to be used from other classes whereas Private variables can only be used within a class.

Return types are normally used to determine what a method should return. If the method is not to return anything, then we use "void".
 
 Comment print function: system.out.printf(format, args): Format is replaced by a string with %s between the quotation marks. %s refers to the string variable being referred to in args.

Instance variable: A variable that's outside a method but inside a class.

 ##VIDEO 17: CONSTRUCTORS
 A constructor is a method with the same name as a class and is used to initialize variables as soon as you create an object. This allows you to avoid calling the setter method. To use it you enter the variable as you create the object within the parameter brackets.

Each object has its own set of variables.

##VIDEO 18:NESTED IF STATEMENTS
This is adding another 'if' conditional within the false statement of the first 'if' conditional. Both correct statements are run along with the program.

this statement is used when more than one option output is required.

##VIDEO 19: ELSE IF STATEMENT
This is a way of giving java many options for an 'if' statement. 'else if' is placed between the 'if' and 'else' statements and can be used multiple times. The statement is only run until the point where the condition is true.

Curly braces are not required in an 'else if' statement. Use when one option is required of many.

##CONDITIONAL OPERATORS
Example of a conditional operator is:
System.out.println(age > 50 ? "Old": "Young")

the question mark in the function makes it a boolean. If age is greater than 50, "Old" is printed. otherwise, "Young" is printed. The value on the left represents true and that on the right represents false.

##VIDEO 21: SIMPLE AVERAGING PROGRAM

import scanner is used when values need to be input when the program runs.

*IMPORT SCANNER*
*Outside the class type: import.java.util.*;
Within the class create object : Scanner Scannerobj = new Scanner(System.in);*
 
Use a while loop. Within the loop set an int variable equal to Scannerobj.nextInt();. Accumulate the sum using the loop and find average using by dividing the total by by the number of integers input.

##VIDEO 22: FOR LOOPS

Structure: for(int x = 0; x>10; x++)

The first statement shows where the loop starts, the second here it ends and the third the increments/decrements the value of the counter undergoes.

##VIDEO 23: COMPOUND INTEREST PROGRAM(COMPOUNDING NUMBERS)

Set the variables: double amount, double principal and double rate. Rate and principal are specified.

Using the for loop set the time as a condition.

* USING POWERS*

 * Formula: MAth.pow(arg0, arg1)*

 * arg0 is the number or expression while arg1 is the power.*
